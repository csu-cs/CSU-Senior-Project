## Problem Statement:
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; An all-in-one medical manager application should be convenient for users to track symptoms, appointments with their healthcare team, and lifestyle factors. The application is easily customizable, organized, and functions quickly and efficiently. Current symptom tracking applications, such as Bearable, CareClinic, and Symptom Tracker lack customizability, organization, and/or features such as note taking, appointment recordings, medication log, and lifestyle factors. These shortfalls significantly reduce the number of users that can effectively use the application and therefore, miss out on the opportunity to take better control of their health. 

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Making modifications to the current structure of some of the well-known symptom tracking applications will allow for additional customizability and organization. Additionally, adding features such as a dedicated appointment notes section will make the app more functional. Users will greatly benefit from these modifications by allowing the application to be useable for users with any one or more physical or mental health symptoms/conditions. Adding additional features will ensure users a true all-in-one medical management application, such that all symptoms, medications, lifestyle factors, general notes, and appointments/hospital notes can be organized and managed in one single and convenient application. In recent years, there has been a much-needed surge of symptom tracker applications being made available to IOS users; however, these applications often fall short in customization and features thereby creating the need for an application that is fully customizable and allows users to keep all medical data and notes in one user friendly applications. 

## Project Description:
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; For my senior project, I will be creating an IOS symptom tracker/medical manager application which will essentially build upon existing apps. This application will be fully customizable, yet user friendly and esthetically pleasing. In addition to symptom tracking, users will be offered the ability to log mood, lifestyle factors (exercise, stress, diet, etc.), goals, gratitude, affirmations, complete journal prompts, general notetaking, appointment notetaking, log medical device application/maintenance, and log medications. Additionally, optional features which may be included are appointment voice recordings, medication/general reminders, custom report generation, and/or synching capabilities with apple watch devices for automatic heart rate, oxygen saturation, sleep, and step logs. Some considerations for this project include compliance with HIPAA laws and application security features to ensure user information remains private and secure.

## Problem Statement:
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; An all-in-one medical manager application should be convenient for users to track symptoms, appointments with their healthcare team, and lifestyle factors. The application is easily custimizeable, organized, and functions quickly and efficiently. Data collected by users of symptom tracking applications, such as Bearable, CareClinic, and Symptom Tracker lack customizeability, organization, and/or features such as note taking, appointment recordings, medication log, and lifestyle factors. These shortfalls significantly reduce the amount of users that can effectively use the application and therefore, miss out on the opportunity to take better control of their health.

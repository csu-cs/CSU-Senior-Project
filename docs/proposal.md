### Problem Statement

## Ideal Situation

Our current system has its problems, but we can fix them by investing in a better check-in/check-out system. Let's focus on safety, accuracy, and efficiency, so our volunteers can concentrate on what truly matters, building relationships and nurturing the spiritual growth of our children.  Imagine if new families could quickly share their information with volunteers, who would then assign classrooms automatically. Returning families could just scan their parent tag, and the system would instantly show their kids' details, making the process speedy and clear. During check-out, parents would return their tags, and volunteers could easily find the right child with a quick scan, ensuring trust and peace of mind.

## The Problem

Our current system is slow and frustrating for new families. Handwritten tags and manual searches lead to mistakes, making parents worried. Volunteers also feel stressed, spending too much time on logistics instead of connecting with kids and families. It's slow, mistake-prone, and stressful for both volunteers and parents. We need a better system that's fast, accurate, and user-friendly to create a safe and welcoming environment for everyone.

## Why

This isn't just about making things easier, it's about trust and safety. Mistakes can cause anxiety and even drive families away. Safety is crucial, and a flawed system could hinder emergency response. Plus, our volunteers need more time for building relationships and creating meaningful experiences for the children.

## Benefits

Let's switch to a digital check-in/check-out system that's easy to use. New families can quickly input information, and the system will automatically assign classrooms and print tags. Returning families just need to scan their tags, and everything pops up instantly. The system will also provide real-time reports, helping us track attendance and plan better.

## Summary

This change will make parents happier and reduce stress for volunteers. Safety will improve with accurate information and quick child identification. Our volunteers will have more time to connect with families, making our ministry even more positive. Families will trust us more, knowing their kids are safe and well-cared for.

## Project Description

With my project I will create a check-in/check-out system that a church can use to check in students for children ministries, Sunday school and daycare.  The first time that a parent checks in their child/children a volunteer will get basic information.
    1. Parent/s names
    2. Parent/s contact information.  Phone number and email.
    3. Child's name/ children's names
    4. Ages
    5. Last grade completed in school by child/children.
    6. Food allergies.
    7. Special Medical Needs
    8. Emergency Contact

After the initial check in the all that information will not need to be provided but there will be an option to update if anything has changed. At and around the check in the desk there will be many QR codes that will be linked to the kid check in page embedded in the churches website. A parent will scan the QR code if there is no changes the parent can go proceed to check-in. The parents enter the child/children's name and a name tag for each child will be printed from an mini-printer that is connected to the churches wifi.  On that tag will be the child's name, classroom assignment, parent info, food allergies(if applicable), medical needs(if applicable), and emergency contact info. If a parent cannot check access the check in system there with be volunteers to assist if needed.  After the tag is printed the parent is will be given an option of either having a hard tag printed or an email sent to them. They will need either to check out the child at the end of service. A volunteer will escort the child to assign classroom. At check-out the parent will either scan the barcode sent to them in email or on the hard tag printed at check-in.  A volunteer will call to the classroom and have the children sent to the desk or and extra volunteer will escort them to front. When in custody the front desk volunteer will acknowledge check out complete and remove the children from the system.

## Proposed Language

Ruby

## Libraries, Packages, Development Kits, etc. to be used in in the proposed implementation languages(s)

1. RubyGems
2. SQL Database
3. AWS Cloud 9

## Additional Software/Equipment Needed

1. Profession Label Printer
2. QR Code Generator
3. QR Code Scanner
4. Laptop
   

## Personal Motivation

This project will enhance my knowledge of building a user friendly website. It will also test my knowledge of website and database security. I will also learn how to interface equipment to work on the same network.

## Outline of Future Research Efforts

1. I will look at other check in systems and see what there strengths and weaknesses are.
2. I will use ruby to build the initial website and use sql to store the data that is gathered.
3. I will use images to make the website make it more appealing.
4. I will use Canva to generate QR codes.     https://www.canva.com/qr-code-generator/
5. Ruby on Rails Tutorial
6. Handheld Scanner Manual
7. Label Printer Manual
8. SQL Database building.                     https://dev.mysql.com/doc/
9. Interface between between equipment.

# Senior Project Proposal

## Student Name: 
Jessica Taylor

## Degree and Major: 
B.S. in Cybersecurity

## Project Advisor Name: 
Dr. Hayes

## Expected Graduation Date: 
December 2024

## Problem Statement:
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; An all-in-one secure personal medical manager application should be convenient for users to track symptoms, appointments with their healthcare team, and lifestyle factors. The application is secure, easily customizable, organized, and functions quickly and efficiently. Current symptom tracking applications, such as Bearable, CareClinic, and Symptom Tracker lack customizability, organization, and/or features such as note taking, appointment recordings, medication log, and lifestyle factors. These shortfalls significantly reduce the number of users that can effectively use the application and therefore, miss out on the opportunity to take better control of their health. 

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Making modifications to the current structure of some of the well-known symptom tracking applications will allow for additional customizability and organization. Additionally, adding features such as a dedicated appointment notes section will make the app more functional. Users will greatly benefit from these modifications by allowing the application to be useable for users with any one or more physical or mental health symptoms/conditions. Adding additional features will ensure users a true all-in-one medical management application, such that all symptoms, medications, lifestyle factors, general notes, and appointments/hospital notes can be organized and managed in one single and convenient application. In recent years, there has been a much-needed surge of symptom tracker applications being made available to IOS users; however, these applications often fall short in customization and features thereby creating the need for an application that is fully customizable and allows users to keep all medical data and notes in one user friendly applications. 

## Project Description:
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; For my senior project, I will be creating an IOS symptom tracker/medical manager application which will essentially build upon existing apps. This application will be fully customizable, yet user friendly and esthetically pleasing. In addition to symptom tracking, users will be offered the ability to log lifestyle factors (exercise, stress, diet, etc.), tasks/goals, set reminders, take notes, and log medications. Additionally, optional features which may be included are appointment voice recordings, and synching capabilities with apple watch devices for automatic heart rate, oxygen saturation, and step logs. Some considerations for this project include compliance with HIPAA laws and application security features to ensure user information remains private and secure.

## Proposed Implementation Language(s): 
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; I will be using Swift as the implementation language to develop my symptom manager IOS application.

## Libraries, Packages, Development Kits, etc. to be used in the proposed implementation languages(s):
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; I will utilize Apple's CloudKit for the application's back end. SwiftUI will be imported to allow for a more aesthetically pleasing user-interface. In addition, Apple's HealthKit will be utilized to allow data synchronization from the health app to this IOS symptom tracker/medical manager application. 

## Additional Software/Equipment Needed:
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; I will need a Mac computer for the software needed to develop this IOS application. This can be done with my 2020 MacBook Air. Xcode is the IDE that I will be using for the development of my IOS application. I will also need to use my Apple ID for the IOS IPhone simulator tool in Xcode.

## Personal Motivation:
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; My motivation for this project stems from me being a patient, myself. I have a systemic autoimmune condition which affects almost every system of my body and requires many specialists and therefore, many appointments. Having the ability to track my symptoms and treatments/medications will allow me to be better manage my health and prepare for medical appointments. I have tried many symptom tracker apps and I have not found one that fits all of my needs. I am excited to incorporate my background in cybersecurity in developing this application due to the need to protect sensitive user information. I look forward to this project and getting the opportunity to combine my two passions: medicine/healthcare and cybersecurity.

## Outline of Future Research Efforts:
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; There are a few things that I will need to research for this project to be completed successfuly. First, I will need to learn Swift. Next, I will need to understand how how Apple's CloudKit and HealthKit work with Swift. If I want to include the voice recording feature, I need to research software that I may use which is compatible with Swift. Finally, I will need to research Swift, HealthKit, and CloudKit security features to ensure the application is secure. I will be utilizing the Swift - Apple Developer website and ios Accademy YouTube videos for most of my research. Deliverables will include symptom log feature, lifestyle log feature, medication log feature, and notes feature. If time permits, I will deliver a reminders feature and voice recorder feature. Finally, I will deliver a test plan/results, final project report, and defense documentation/presentation.

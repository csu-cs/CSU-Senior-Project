# Senior Project 2024

## Ideal Situation

Our current system has its problems, but we can fix them by investing in a better check-in/check-out system. Let's focus on safety, accuracy, and efficiency, so our volunteers can concentrate on what truly matters, building relationships and nurturing the spiritual growth of our children.  Imagine if new families could quickly share their information with volunteers, who would then assign classrooms automatically. Returning families could just scan their parent tag, and the system would instantly show their kids' details, making the process speedy and clear. During check-out, parents would return their tags, and volunteers could easily find the right child with a quick scan, ensuring trust and peace of mind.

## The Problem

Our current system is slow and frustrating for new families. Handwritten tags and manual searches lead to mistakes, making parents worried. Volunteers also feel stressed, spending too much time on logistics instead of connecting with kids and families. It's slow, mistake-prone, and stressful for both volunteers and parents. We need a better system that's fast, accurate, and user-friendly to create a safe and welcoming environment for everyone.

## Why

This isn't just about making things easier, it's about trust and safety. Mistakes can cause anxiety and even drive families away. Safety is crucial, and a flawed system could hinder emergency response. Plus, our volunteers need more time for building relationships and creating meaningful experiences for the children.

## Benefits

Let's switch to a digital check-in/check-out system that's easy to use. New families can quickly input information, and the system will automatically assign classrooms and print tags. Returning families just need to scan their tags, and everything pops up instantly. The system will also provide real-time reports, helping us track attendance and plan better.

## Summary

This change will make parents happier and reduce stress for volunteers. Safety will improve with accurate information and quick child identification. Our volunteers will have more time to connect with families, making our ministry even more positive. Families will trust us more, knowing their kids are safe and well-cared for.

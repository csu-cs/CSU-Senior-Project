## Course, Department, and University Policies

### Academic Integrity and the Honor Code

All students are expected to adhere to Charleston Southern University’s [Code of Academic Honesty](https://www.charlestonsouthern.edu/wp-content/uploads/Policy-R-58-updated-Feb-2020.pdf). For example, all work must be original and must not be copied from another student. Failure to follow this guideline will be considered a violation of the code and will be treated accordingly. Students are encouraged to ask their instructor(s) for clarification regarding their academic dishonesty standards.

### Course Evaluations

To pursue our mission of *Academic Excellence in a Christian Environment*, we must receive feedback from students. The student-feedback survey is online and will be available to students in the second half of the semester. Students are strongly encouraged to complete the short evaluation survey, which is anonymous. Your professor will let you know when the survey is available. The survey will be available through your MyCSU account. We greatly value your opinion!

### Student Representatives

These are students who are designated by letter to represent the University on official business (e.g., athletic, music, and similar events). If officially scheduled absences cause these students to miss tests, assignments, and/or other similar academic activities, University policy allows these to be made up without penalty. Following this policy, Student Representatives may opt to either make-up tests *before* departure or supplanting missed tests with the final exam grade. Final exams must always be taken *before* departure to avoid an Incomplete for the course. Scheduled assignments remain subject to the lateness policy and must be turned in before departure to avoid lateness penalties. Student Representatives are responsible to inform the instructor of official absences and to make all appropriate arrangements.

### Internet Etiquette

Charleston Southern University (CSU) holds students, faculty, and staff to the highest standards of conduct and expects all to demonstrate courteous behaviors and practices in online communications. This policy includes guidelines and recommendations for online communications. Being respectful, thoughtful, meaningful, and ethical are fundamental to good netiquette.

CSU's basic netiquette rules are:

*  Course communications are for internal use only and considered confidential. Do not forward or quote discussion posts, emails, or other course communications to outside parties.
*  Never share personal login usernames, IDs or passwords.
*  Do not type in all capital letters. It is perceived online as shouting.
*  Use proper capitalization, grammar, spelling, and punctuation conventions for professional communications.
*  Avoid texting jargon or abbreviations without explanation.
    *   Incorrect: "CSU is a wonderful university."
    *   Correct: "Charleston Southern University (CSU) is a wonderful university."
*  Be mindful of sending emails. Ensure that content is relevant and pay attention to *Reply* versus *Reply All*. 
*  BucMail is the only email allowed for course communications. Other platforms (Yahoo, Gmail, etc.) are prohibited. 
*  In video conferencing, mute your microphone when not speaking.
*  Differing views are natural and welcome in discussion boards. Be respectful in your comments-even if you disagree or dislike someone's position on a topic. 
*  Respect the time and availability of students, faculty, and staff. Emails should be addressed within 24 hours of receipt. Keep in mind that traditional faculty work hours are 8 a.m. - 5 p.m. EST.

### Disability Services

Any student who may need accommodations should review the requirements/procedures on the [Disability Services website](https://www.charlestonsouthern.edu/academics/student-success-center/disability-services/). Once approved to receive accommodations through Disability Services, the student will need to contact the instructor.

### COVID-19 Considerations

Students must report symptoms or exposure PRIOR to their absence by screening via Live Safe or emailing <lglover@csuniv.edu> and must respond to all follow-up communication (via email or telephone) in a timely (i.e., 12-24 hours) manner.

**PLEASE do not meet in-person if you are sick. By doing so you are helping ensure the safety of your fellow students and the CSU staff and faculty. You must e-mail instructors before the meeting to inform them you’re sick or have been exposed to COVID-19. You can communicate remotely with your faculty advisor and project team.**

### Nondiscrimination Policy and Student Rights

Charleston Southern University does not illegally discriminate based on race, color, national or ethnic origin, sex, disability, age, religion, genetic information, veteran or military status, or any other basis.  Inquiries regarding the non-discrimination policies should be directed to Latitia R. Adams, Title IX Coordinator, 843-863-7374, <ladams@csuniv.edu>.  Students should refer to the [CSU Student Handbook](https://www.charlestonsouthern.edu/wp-content/uploads/studenthandbook.pdf) to be fully informed of their rights and remedies.
